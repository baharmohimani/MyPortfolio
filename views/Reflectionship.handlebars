        <li>Created an app to track your relationship</li>
        <li>Branding: We have decided that the brand name, Reflectionship, strongly<br> represents the intention of our application. The title is a combination of the words<br> relationship and reflection, which, in as few syllables as possible, sums up the<br> appâ€™s purpose. </li>
        <li>track your relationship with your partner, friend or boss</li>
        <li>getting a suggestion for conversation idea</li>
        <li>Created a structured team consisting of 3 team members</li>
        <!-- <li>2 of us were Computer Science major and our other member was Cognitive science major</li> -->
        <li>my role was doing both coding part; html/CSS and java script, and <br> completing the user testing as well</li>
      </ul>

      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>we started with sketching the prototypes, here is homepage and our conversation idea page prototype: </li>

        <p><img src = " ../images/RProConversation.jpeg" width="500" height=auto align="middle"> </img ></p>

        <li>Our inspirations for this product is to create an efficient and consistent way not only to constinuously reflect on the<br> emotional state in a relationship, but also to encourage improvement in the relationship. Our inspirations have lead us to<br> incorporate tracking emotion data and reflecting on it and the importance of critically analyzing or attempting to <br>improve the relationship you are monintoring. </li>
        <li>I worked on the main skeleton of our code</li>
        <li>We choose a blue nav bar as our nav bar because we agreed that blue shows peace and comfort</li>

        <li>My other partner and i were completed the home page</li>

        <p><img src = " ../images/Rhome.png" width="350" height=auto align="middle"> </img ></p>
        <li>I completed the login page and linked it to the home page</li>
        <li>i chose a login picture as a happy face because i wanted<br>to see the smile on the face of the people who are looking <br>on our app and give them that positive reflection</li>
        <p><img src = " ../images/Rlogin.png" width="350" height=auto align="middle"> </img ></p>
        <li>I completed the conversation idea page which gives the user the conversation idea suggestion</li>
        <p><img src = " ../images/Rconversation.png" width="350" height=auto align="middle"> </img ></p>
        <li>I also created the google analytics code for our website to see how many users are coming to our<br> website, how they come and which buttons they press more and how long they stay in each page</li>

        <p><img src = " ../images/GoogleAnalytics.png" width="600" height=auto align="middle"> </img ></p>
        <li>Then i completed the user testing and asked about 40 people to test our app</li>
        <p><img src = " ../images/user.png" width="300" height=auto align="middle"> </img ></p>
        <li>After we got the results from the user testing we modified our app based on the feedbacks that<br> we got from our users</li>
        <li>After we modified our app design and functionality based on the user testing we iterate again and had some <br>more users to test our app and we modified the design of the app based on the feedback that we got</li>
        <li>The main challenge that we faced was that non of us had a web design exprience so we all had to learn it at the <br>same time as doing the assignment, after we figured that out and we published our app we faced the<br> user experience challenge, they didn't know how to work with our app unless we were telling them, so we figured <br>that we should put an instruction on how to use the app for our users plus making our design much simpler so it <br>will be much more self explanatory</li>
        <li>Our final product, which is the Reflectionship app focuses on helping track relationships. Users are able to enter their<br> emotions regarding personal relationships of their choosing, including romantic relationships, friendships<br>and even professional relationships. By tracking their emotions in the relationship they are going to <br>be able to track their overall emotion and progression in the relationship, they are better able to make informed <br>decisions on their relationships. The Reflectionship application also provides features to help improve the relationship,<br> like a conversation ideas feature and a user profile where they can store all of the important <br>information about the relationship. Because humans are social beings, this need is applicable to all people willing <br>to invest in tracking their day to day relationships.</li>
