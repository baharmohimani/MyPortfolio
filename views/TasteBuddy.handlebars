                          <li>Managed interaction among front-end and back-end developers and made-up client (student group in class)</li>
                          <li>Kept a log of user stories and user need</li>
                          <li>Managed in-person meetings, and skype calls between the team members and client</li>
                          <li>Managed the schedule to meet key milestones and deadlines
                          </li>
                          <li>Divided app development to multiple phases, and reported progress to meet clientâ€™s expectation</li>
                        </ul>
                      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                      <li>created a login screen</li>
                      <li>The design desision for login screen was not straight forward, we wanted to choose a backgroud image that shows<br> delisous food so it makes our users to sign in, on the other hand since we wanted to make our background image astonishing we <br>had to make the sign in button less notifing</li>
                      <li>After we did some user testing we figured that we made a right desition on the login background image because users<br> were more willing to sign in when they see an image of really good food</li>
                      <p><img src = " ../images/login.png" width="250" height=auto align="middle"></img ></p>
                      <li> Implemented the buttons in the createaccount page</li>
                      <li>We created a dark background for our main theme of the app because we though that if it is dark it's much fancier<br> on the other hand we thought that users may imply a bad reflection when they see a dark background<br> so we asked a couple of our friends to test it and most of them liked the dark background so we got stuck with it</li>
                      <p><img src = " ../images/createaccount.png" width="250" height=auto align="middle"></img ></p>
                      <li>created button in post login screen</li>
                      <li>Again here we wanted the background image to be more astonishing then the buttons and since we wanted to be<br > consistent with our other pages we chose the button color the same color as our main theme</li>
                      <p><img src = " ../images/postlogin.png" width="250" height=auto align="middle"></img ></p>
                      <li>For each decision that we wanted to make we had a quick stand up meeting by a blackboard, <br>for instance here we wanted to work on the main tables: <br>Menu table: ID, name, ingredient, price, Image<br>Customer Info: ID, First Name, Last Name, email address, password, number of order, restriction (if you have allergy)<br>Order history: customer ID, Ingredient in order
                      </li>
                      <p><img src = " ../images/database.png" width="600" height=auto align="middle"></img ></p>
                      <li>The user of this app are restaurant owners, so the first time that they have the customer they will give them a tablet to<br> sign up for the TasteBuddy app, they will write their likes and dislikes and based on those the TasteBuddy give them <br>recommendation based on the ingredients they like and it will make sure that the food that its recommending does not <br>have the stuff that they disliked in it. </li>
                      </ul>
