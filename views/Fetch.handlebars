                          <li>Problem definition:<br>OneStep does not have an efficient way to organize donor information and communicate with donors.<br> This is vital for them to maintain relationships with donors in order to continue receiving donations for important</br> causes. An efficient and organized system of managing and communicating with donors will also allow them to<br> do more things with their time which will in turn lead to more donor contacts and donations.</li>
                          <li>We came up with some solution and designed some prototypes which i put some of the ones that i worked on here</li>
                          <li>Landing Page: The landing page educates the user about the features that Fetch has. It also directs the users<br>to the search page by hitting the “Try it out!” button. We are making the landing page minimal so that it would be easy<br>for the users to use.
                          </li> 
                        
                        <p><img src = " ../images/landing.png" width="250" height=auto align="middle"></img></p>
                        <li>Fetch Page: The Fetch page provides a timeline of calls and emails for a specific donor. This page<br>recommends the next action to take in order to maintain relationship with this donor. Then the user could<br>select whether he completed the recommended action or not.
                        </li>
                        <p><img src = " ../images/fetch.png" width="450" height=auto align="middle"></img></p>
                        <li>Search Page: The search page first lists some donors which are recommended for the users to contact,<br> it also allows the users to search for donors based on name or location. The search results will<br>appear below and the user will have the options to call, email, or add the donor to their contacts.
                        </li>
                        <p><img src = " ../images/searchRecom.png" width="450" height=auto align="middle"></img></p>
                        <li>Contact Update Page: When a user selects “New Update”, this pop-up box appears,<br> which allows user to update phone, email, communication, payment and outcome<br> information. The user will also be able to upload pictures or videos of events/meetings/etc. <br>Each of the icons at the top of the window allows for the contact record to be updated <br>in a different way. 
                        </li>
